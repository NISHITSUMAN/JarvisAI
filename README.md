firstly,in engine/auth/samples, replace my handsome photos with yours just in same way i did. you can use AI (ChatGPT) for it, like i gave one video of my self with this prompt- here is my video. i am developing a ai desktop assistant where there is a thing called face authentication so for that i need 100 images of just of my face to train my ai assistant. here i have attached a video. extract perfect 100 images from its frame and crop all other parts of each frame photo exceot my face of all angles and things so ai can identitfy me easily. and provide me a zip file of that
then ask it rename the photos with this prompt- this zip files contains a folder with some jpg files inside it. rename all jpg file without changing their format in this order and then provide a zip file of that renamed thing. formate- face.1.(number from 1 to 100 starting from 1 and only 1 number per file.) example, for first file- face.1.1, for second- face.1.2, for third- face.1.3, etc
done now you just need to install some python mmodules using pip in cmd. here are the commands-
pip install pillow
pip install opencv-python
pip install eel
pip install hugchat
pip install numpy
pip install playsound
pip install pvporcupine
pip install pyaudio
pip install pyautogui
pip install pyttsx3
pip install pywhatkit
pip install SpeechRecognition
